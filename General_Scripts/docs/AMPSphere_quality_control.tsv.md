**AMPSphere_quality_control**

**Description:**	AMPs were submitted to different
                                    tests to ensure their quality.
   More info, please visit:
   [AMPSphere quality link](https://ampsphere.big-data-biology.org/quality_tests)

   Columns: 
   amp - AMP access code in AMPSphere
   Antifam - checks spurious gene predictions
   RNAcode - checks gene signatures (Passed, Failed, Not tested*)
   metaproteomes - checks for peptides in metaproteomic studies from PRIDE
   metatranscriptomes - checks for peptides mapping to at least two reads from metatranscriptomes
   terminal placement - checks if it represents a gene fragment

   * refer to those peptides that due to experimental conditions
     could not be tested
