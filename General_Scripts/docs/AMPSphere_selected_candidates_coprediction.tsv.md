**AMPSphere_selected_candidates_coprediction**

**Description:**	Candidates passing in at least 60% of the solubility/synthesis criteria
                        along with all quality criteria (about 5.6k) were assessed. These peptides
                        undergone a test of AMP prediction in other 6 different systems:
                        AI4AMP, amPEPpy, ampir, AMPScanner v2, APIN, AMPlify.

   These results were merged in a table with the following columns:
   amp - AMPSphere access code
   AI4AMP, AmPEPpy, ampir, AMPlify, AMPScannerv2, and APIN - prediction (AMP/non-AMP)
   pcts - percent of co-prediction as AMP
   prediction - if pcts > 0.5 then it was predicted as AMP
