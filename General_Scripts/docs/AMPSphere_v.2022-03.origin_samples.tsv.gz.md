**AMPSphere_v.2022-03.origin_samples.tsv**

**Description:**	TSV-file containing the origins for each candidate AMP in the AMPSphere resource. 
                        It was generated by affiliating each AMP to their genes from each sample, and classifying
                        such samples into progenomes/metagenomes.

| genes | genes accessions for the referred candidate AMP |
| progenomes | samples in which those genes were detected from progenomes resource  |
| metagenomes | samples in which those genes were detected from the metagenomes set used in AMPSphere |
