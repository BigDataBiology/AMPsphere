**AMPsphere_representatives.faa**

**Description:**	Fasta file containing the representative candidate AMP peptide sequences
                        for the clusters obtained in the AMPSphere. The procedure to determine
                        the representative involved sorting the sequences by length, selecting
                        the longest ones and sorting them alphabetically retrieving the first
                        instance.
