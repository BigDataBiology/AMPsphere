**RNAcode_out_wlfam.tsv**

**Description:**	Pre-compiled results for the RNAcode test for protein-coding sequences. 
                        This TSV-file brings the results as Failed (non-protein coding),
                        Passed (protein-coding sequence), or 'not tested' (when the number of genes
                        was inferior to three). The AMP accessions refer to the AMPSphere resource.
