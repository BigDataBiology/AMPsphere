**Description:**	Box plot showing the candidates AMP density as number of AMP genes
                        per assembled Gbp per sample per habitat. Here the two colors (Blue and 
                        Orange) show animal-host-associated and non-host-associated environments
                        clearly arranged by their Q50 (medians). These two groups can be observed 
                        separated, with the host-associated samples with higher medians. Some exceptions
                        include non-host-associated environments which held a close relationship
                        with animal hosts.
