**Description:**	Results for the coordinates test. It consisted in the systematic
                        verification of preceding stop codons for each small ORF identified
                        througout the AMPSphere/GMSC resource. We reported the results for the
                        metagenome-derived small ORFs as those from genomes were not evaluated.
                        The TSV-file consists of two columns, the first bringing the unique 
                        gene identifier and the second showing if the gene was (T) or not (F)
                        preceeded by a stop codon, which would make our prediction of its
                        non-spurious nature stronger, since genes preceeded by stop codons
                        have lower chances of being fragmented larger genes.
