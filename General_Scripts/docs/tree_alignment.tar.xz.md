**tree_alignment.tar**

**Description:**	Folder containing the P1 gene alignments used to build the ML tree to 
                        type the *M. pneumoniae* genomes available in the NCBI and used in the 
                        ProGenomes2 database. These genomes were assessed using Macrel and were
                        part of the AMPSphere project. The tree was important to type most of the
                        genomes in the system of 2 strain types from the P1 gene architecture.
                        Newick files (*.nwk) are canonical tree files possible to visualize with
                        iTOL.
