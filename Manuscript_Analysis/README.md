# AMPSphere v2022-03 data and scripts

- It contains the files and scripts to generate analysis and figures in AMPSphere
  paper.


## Info

This repository contains a `data/` folder with all files needed to run the analysis and tests in the AMPSphere paper.
To run these files you will need a python3 system and a sort of other softwares listed in the requirements file
`environment.yml` that can be easily used to create a conda environment using the command:

```
$ cd AMPSphere_v2022_03_annex/
$ conda env create -f environment.yml -n ampsphere_envo
$ conda activate ampsphere_envo
```

To execute the codes from the `uscripts/` folder, you simply can run the scripts directly:

```
$ python3 uscripts/<script_of_choice>.py
```

The outputs should be generated in the current folder. To have an idea of which script generates a given output, 
please give it a look in the [contents_map.md](docs/contents_map.md) file. It is a table with the resource generated by each 
script and where it was used in the AMPSphere paper.

**Alternatively**: You can access the analysis pipeline and pre-view of results by name in the jupyter notebooks in this
folder, or also, by re-executing the commands locally after download the repository.
