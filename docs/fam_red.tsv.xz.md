**Description:**	TSV-file containing the AMP families found by sample and species clusters of ProGenomes v2.
                        It is used in the analysis of Heap's Law (to verify the opennes- or closedness- of microbial
                        pangenomes). Although not included in the final manuscript, it is interesting to verify
                        the diversity of AMPs included in different taxonomy groups.
