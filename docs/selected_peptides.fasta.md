**selected_peptides**

**Description:**	fasta file containing suggested peptides for testing.
                        Among the set of 50 peptides selected, we included three different classes: 15 homologs matching
                        in some extension to peptides from databases such as DRAMP and smProt; 1 peptide found among
                        those in the FMT story, and the 34 most frequent peptides in our set, as "high copies".
